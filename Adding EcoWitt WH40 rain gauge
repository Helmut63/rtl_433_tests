Hi, I just received a new WH40 rain gauge from EcoWitt and expected to have it added to my Weather station based on rtl-sdr and weewx.

I have already tried different things, but couldnÂ´t get any reading after running the driver alone, neither with "-S all" option, where it just writes a file in the form of  "g037_433.92M_250k.cu8" but nothing of value is displayed.
While reading the file with the suggested -a and -A paramters, som info is dislpayed but surely only for experts and not for me as newbie.

I ordered producto from China @433Mhz as I have my whole product running at this frequency.

I'd appreciate your help on what steps would be necessary to have this sensor added to rtl_433 driver.

Thanks and regards
